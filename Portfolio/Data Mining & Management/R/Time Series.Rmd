EXERCISE 4.4.1
Create a times series object starting at 1990 with value 100 and ending in 2000 in which for each even month, the value increases with 2% the previous month, and each odd month decreases with 1%. What is the final value?

```{r}
Value <- 100
Stored_values <- c()

# 132 the number of months from 1990 to 2000 (11 (years) * 12 (months in a year))
for(x in 1:132){
  if (x%%2 == 1){ #If the value is odd
    Value = Value*(1.0 - 0.01) #Value decreases by 1%
  } 
  else { #else (for the even values)
    Value = Value*(1.0 + 0.02) #Value is increases by 2%
  }
  Stored_values <- c(Stored_values, Value)
}

Month <- ts(data = Stored_values, start = 1990, frequency = 12)
Month
